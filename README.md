# robotics

This repository contains the lab projects for the robotics course 2020/2021 at [**Politecnico di Milano**](https://www.polimi.it/).
Both the projects are implemented in [**ROS**](https://www.ros.org/), an open-source robotics middleware suite.

## project 1

Given a bag with:
* 4 motor speed (RPM)
* simple odometry provided by the manufacturer
* ground truth pose of the robot (acquired with OptiTrack)

the project1 aims to:
* compute odometry using skid steering (approx) kinematics
  - using Euler and Runge-Kutta integration
  - ROS parameter specifies initial pose
* use dynamic reconfigure to select between integration method
* write 2 services to reset the odometry to (0,0) or to a pose(x,y,Î¸)
* publish a custom message with odometry value and type of
integration

## project 2

Given some bags with various data coming from sensors deployed on a Scout 2.0 [**AgileX robot**](https://www.agilex.ai/?lang=zh-cn), the project2 aims to:
* estimate the angle between the robot and the lidar
* build a map using [**Gmapping**](https://github.com/ros-perception/slam_gmapping)
* perform localization using both [**amcl**](http://wiki.ros.org/amcl) and [**robot_localization**](http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/robot_localization/html/index.html)
